            </h2>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project and its researchers value privacy, transparency, accountability, and openness. We have worked with the city, the public, and legal experts to create governance and privacy policies that reflect these principles.</p>

            <p class="lead">AoT privacy and governance policies were developed initially in the second half of 2015 and reviewed through a workshop including legal, academic, ethics, and privacy experts from the City of Chicago, the University of Chicago, Indiana University's Trusted CI (NSF Cybersecurity Center of Excellence) in early 2016.  Throughout the first half of 2016 a series of public meetings were held to engage Chicasgo residents and community groups, and after this six-month period of public comment the policies were finalized and adopted.  Since that time the project has regularly reviewed the policies and found them to be effective, thus they have remained unchanged. You can download the governance and privacy policies <a href="/final-policies.pdf">here</a>.</p>
            
            <p class="lead">We thank the public for their valuable input during the feedback period in the spring and summer of 2016. We have <a href="/policy-responses.html">published responses</a> to all questions received online and during public engagement meetings. </a>You can also view a final <a href="engagement-report.html">Engagement Report</a> from <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago</a>, summarizing the public feedback period and lessons learned from these outreach efforts.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Privacy-preseving Image and Sound Processing</h2>

            <p>The AoT privacy policy details the AoT project emphasis on privacy, transparency, and openness.  AoT devices save roughly one image and one 30s sound clip on an hourly basis in order to create a library of such data types, necessary to "train" the image and sound processing software.  This library is protected and only available to scientists who (a) propose to develop vision/hearing applications that comply with the AoT Privacy Policy, and (b) sign a data use agreement outlining restrictions on sharing any images or sound that could potentially identify an individual.</p>

            <p>With the exception of the training data, no images or sound clips are saved. Rather, the nodes include computers that allow scientists to run image and sound analysis software within the nodes themselves.  Once images or sound clips are processed by this software, they are <b>deleted</b> </p>

            <p>All of the original AoT nodes have been retired in place in September 2021, to be replaced by more powerful devices currently being tested at Argonne National Laboratory. Four of these new nodes have been installed for testing.  These are at (1) 5th and Sacramento, (2) 87th and Cottage Grove, (3) Lake and Dearborn, and (4) Jackson and State.  The first two are supporting flood detection applications; the second two (in the Loop) are supporting applications such as traffic flow analysis, pedestrian and vehicle counts, etc.</p> Prior to the original nodes being retired, the AoT team worked with <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/project-eclipse/">Microsoft Research</a>, JCDecaux, the Enironmental Law and Policy Center, and other partners to design and install a network of 115 air pollution sensors in summer 2021 on Chicago bus shelters as a field-test for experimental sensors. An <a href="https://urban.microsoft.com/air/city/chicago">interactive map of these devices can be accessed here</a> or by scanning a QR code that is placed on each of the bus shelters hosting one of these nodes.  The project team also worked with five community groups from Chicago's West and South sides to identify locations for the sensors. </p>
            
            <p>Information regarding all vision and hearing applications under development or in use, including links to software used, is maintained at the 
            <a href="https://portal.sagecontinuum.org/apps/explore">SAGE Applications web page</a>

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">AoT Annual Reports</h2>

            <p>At the close of each Federal fiscal year (September) the AoT project produced annual reports. These are available after a period of review by the National Science Foundation, thus will typically appear at the end of each calendar year. These parts are cumulative so that when read stand-alone they include both new activities and accomplishments and key accomplishments to date.  As such, there is some duplication from year to year and the most recent reports are the most comprehensive.</p>
