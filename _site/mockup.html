            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What if a light pole told you to watch out for an icy patch of sidewalk ahead? What if an app told you the most populated route for a late-night walk to the El station by yourself? What if you could get weather and air quality information block-by-block, instead of city-by-city?</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is a network of interactive, modular sensor boxes around Chicago to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use.</p>

            </h2>
              <ul class="lead">  
                <li>To better understand the natural and built environment of the city and its impact on livability with respect to climate, air quality, noise, and other factors, effectively creating a "fitness tracker" for Chicago.
                <li>To make this data available to citizens, software developers, scientists, and policymakers so that all can work together to make cities healthier, more livable and more efficient.
                <li>To enable research, development, prototyping and demonstration of new capabilities that require hardware and software technologies to be “embedded” in the built infrastructure.
                <li>To enable new training and education opportunities in science and technology, particularly related to cities.</ul><br>
              <p class="lead">AoT intends to operate as a “national instrument” for urban science and technology research, ranging from technology to social sciences and education.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Data is Collected?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sensors are aimed primarily at understanding atmosphere, air quality, and environmental factors: temperature, humidity, light, CO, NO2, vibration.</p>

            <p class="lead">Three sensors are affected by human activity. A sound sensor will collect data on ambient volume. An infared camera, pointed at nearby sidewalk and road surfaces, collects temperature information. A wireless LAN can count the number of Bluetooth- or WiFi-enabled devices in the vicinity, as a proxy for pedestrian traffic. The sensors do not record any identifying information from devices.</p>

            </h2>

            <p class="lead">Potential applications of data collected by the Array of Things include:</p>    
            
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Monitor air quality and determine the healthiest and unhealthiest walking paths and times through the city
              <li>Detect temperature of sidewalks and roads to guide more targeted and efficient salting in winter
              <li>Measure and record micro-climate in different areas of the city
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated to suggest safe routes
              <li>Detect heavy traffic through sound and vibration
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">We hope that collaboration with the community will lead to further valuable applications.</p>
