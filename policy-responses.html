We are evaluating the use of a Gortex sock around the air quality sensors to reduce ice and dust exposure.

            <p>The School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) has been involved in the physical design of the nodes since the early conception of the project.  Faculty members from SAIC also worked with the AoT project and faculty members at Lane Tech High School to develop and pilot a high school curriculum on Internet of Things and sensor networks.</p>
   
            <p>Smart Chicago Collaborative is assisting the project with community engagement, enabling the project to leverage their experience in this area. </p>

			<p>The National Science Foundation funding program required all proposals to include cost sharing, and the project received engineering support from six companies (Cisco, Intel, Microsoft, Motorola Solutions, Schneider Electric, and Zebra Technologies).  In early 2016 the University of Chicago expanded its longstanding AT&T partnership to include the Array of Things, making AT&T the seventh industry partner.</p>

			<p>Scientists from over 30 universities and national laboratories have been active in workshops and project planning for the past three years, and will continue to advise the project and to leverage the data to better understand urban systems.</p>

            <p>The software used by the nodes is open source, enabling community-based testing, input, and review.  Responsibility for accepting software changes and for managing the software versions running on nodes lies with the project team, all of whose work is governed by ethical and privacy agreements, including the project governance and privacy policies.  The review process includes checks for compliance with privacy policies and goals as well as stability, security, and other factors.</p>

            <p><b>Avoid language of "data ownership” - data cannot legally be owned (in the United States). This is not just cosmetic, it's important not to introduce a legally indefensible concept into a document that will (we hope) be a binding understanding of how the AoT will work. The idea that data will not only be owned by someone, by the University of Chicago particularly, adds a level of political sensitivity that is unnecessary and possibly counterproductive.</b></p>
                
            <p>Data ownership is standard legal language.  By “ownership” we mean the University of Chicago will copyright the data and have responsibility to ensure that the data remains open and available through the course of the project and beyond, and that any data publication is done within the rubric of the privacy policy.  To avoid confusion or unnecessary debate we have modified the text to use the word “stewardship.”  The terms of usage will be similar to what is commonly used for open data such as is available from the National Weather Service or other open data sites.  These terms will be based on the MIT license terms, adapted to apply to data. Information on the MIT license can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License. The National Weather Service also provides a good example of the terms of use that Array of Things will adopt.  http://www.weather.gov/disclaimer.

"If a regular evaluation determines that the AoT is unable to meet the goals of the program, or if the program is producing a preponderance of adverse effects, it may be discontinued." (or the like) The public may well be scared at a new level of surveillance/coveillance and reassurances that misuse of the data will be stopped will go a long way towards encouraging acceptance. </b></p>
                
            <p>The regular evaluation of the project includes the possibility for discontinuing the project.  Additionally, the National Science Foundation will review the project annually. The project’s funding ends in 2018, after which all parties will review the project and determine whether to extend it. As detailed in the privacy policy, the devices will not collect personal information nor provide any other surveillance capability.</p>

            <p>Other than several candidate environmental sensors such as rain or carbon dioxide, no new or experimental sensors are expected prior to the first annual review of the project and policies. </p>

			<p>Experimental sensors proposed by parties outside the AoT project team will be reviewed by the project team (system operators) and the Scientific Review Group.  If the sensors have any potential to detect personal information then a plan must be included as to how their use will comply with the privacy policy, and in these cases that plan will also be reviewed by the Technical Security and Privacy Group. As part of the agreement to test new sensors, outside parties must agree that once the sensor research/evaluation is complete then all validated data stored at Argonne will be published openly.</p>

These images will contain no sensitive PII, but some may show faces or license plate numbers.  The University of Chicago, as copyright holder of the data, would be responsible for responding to law enforcement requests.

            <p>As outlined in the published privacy and governance policies, new sensors or data collection capabilities will undergo multiple review processes including technical feasibility, scientific merit, and implications with respect to privacy and compliance to the privacy policy.  The project website will be updated to include any new sensors or capabilities if they pass these review processes.  Similarly, if capabilities are removed from the devices this will be noted on the website and elsewhere.</p>

            <p><b>Not saying "camera imagery" is misleading. The data that will be gathered IS IMAGES. Pedestrian and vehicle movement information will be inferred from that data. And it is absolutely 100% certain that unless this policy says that imagery will only be used for pedestrian and vehicle movement, then it WILL be used for something else. Using data in creative ways is exactly what data scientists get paid to do. This absolutely must be rewritten. </b></p>
                
            <p>This wording was not intended to mislead—in normal language we refer to images with the understanding that they come from cameras.</p>

			<p>The wording, “This includes, but is not limited to…” makes it clear that the measurement of pedestrian and vehicle movement are examples, and that we expect new image processing applications to be developed. The purpose of the document is to outline policy and processes to protect privacy while supporting new image processing capabilities not listed in these examples (for instance, detection of standing water or ice on the roadway).  This includes a process for reviewing the potential privacy impact of any data published by new image processing capabilities to ensure that they are compliant with the privacy policy.</p>

            <p>The policy documents include reference to the project website, where the project maintains information on the specific capabilities of the nodes. The website currently has this information, including a list of initial features/information to be extracted from images, in the node configuration schematic.</p>

			<p>In addition, the technical specifications and data sheets for each sensor on each node will also be published with the data.</p> 

			<p>The suggestion to provide tables is a very good one and thus this data will also be formatted into tables for clarity.</p>

         <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <p><b>This is a concerning piece of wording and implementation of this proposal. This makes me have to ask about the specific management rules of these images - who has access, how long will they be stored, and how do they get deleted?  If these images are never deleted, then the entire PII section of this document is void from a technical perspective. With enough images taken over time, one can find an individual based on their clothing, follow them through each image, and eventually determine where they work and where they live. From there, it's pretty easy to figure out the rest of that person's identity. Blurring out images and license plates is not enough.  To me, I think it would be better if a smarter solution could be implemented to where images are not even needed for these metrics (i.e. traffic patterns). I don't know what that solution would be, but I'm more afraid of the potential of future harm to be done with these images more than anything.</b></p>
                
            <p>The policy document has been updated to clarify that image processing for the street-facing cameras will be done on the nodes themselves, and the images will then be deleted - not saved or transmitted.  For calibration of image processing software, a fraction of 1% of images will be randomly saved.  This limited set of images will contain no sensitive PII.  Some may potentially show faces or license plates, and while these are not considered sensitive PII the project has elected nonetheless to limit access to those images to approved individuals who have signed usage agreements, as outlined in the published privacy policy document.</p>

            <p><b>Although most citizens may not care, the technically minded ones would be interested in knowing exactly how this data is secured and encrypted. There are different ways of doing so and being transparent about that is important IMO.</b></p>
                
            <p>All data transmission is encrypted via OpenSSL.  Although none of the limited set of calibration images (the fraction of 1% not deleted in the nodes) will contain sensitive PII, the methodology for securing calibration images will follow NIST guidelines for control, audit, and protection of sensitive data, for example using AES-256 or similarly strong encryption methods.  The open source software stack is also published in Github (waggle-sensor) where the project encourages the technical community to comment and contribute to its evolution.</p>

            <p>All sensor data, with the exception of the limited set of calibration images from the street-facing cameras, will be uploaded to an open data system operated by the University of Chicago and Argonne National Laboratory.  This data, containing no PII, will be retained for future use indefinitely.  In normal operation, images will be processed on the node and deleted within minutes.  For calibration, a fraction of 1% of images will be maintained and protected at Argonne National Laboratory.  If and when the Array of Things project concludes, these images will be either processed to remove possible identifiers (faces or license plate numbers) or deleted.</p>

            <p>Several organizations and individuals approached the project with interest in air quality and related health issues such as asthma, including some with concerns about factories and expressway emissions.  After learning that the Instituto del Progresso Latino, located near factories and the Stevenson Expressway, focuses on healthcare careers we met with their leadership to explore their interest in air quality data and engaging students.   The Pilsen neighborhood also has a history of community organization around improving air quality, and nodes in this part of city [Pilsen] will help to better understand air quality impacted by factories and expressways.</p>

There are some sensors that we expect to be able to add in the near term, such as precipitation, wind, and carbon dioxide, but that are either too expensive or otherwise impractical for the first set of installations.  We expect that these and other new sensors will become practical in 2017 and beyond, and hope to integrate them into the platform.</p>

            <p>There are several ways that these images are used for developing and improving image processing software.  To illustrate, consider software intended to count bicycles.  First the software must be “trained” to recognize bicycles by having the software process a set of images of bicycles.  Second, the software must be tested and improved to perform under various conditions that might impair the image, such as different lighting and weather conditions. </p>

            <p>We anticipate facing this challenge in the initial node deployment. Lots of things can lead to clogged sensors, including birds, insects, dust and ice. We are evaluating the use of a Gortex sock around the air quality sensors to reduce ice and dust exposure. As with many other environmental challenges to the node technology, we will learn from analyzing and observing the performance and any challenges with the first round of nodes and make changes to improve reliability of subsequent nodes.</p>

The project team is responsible for managing data in compliance with the privacy policies.

            <p>The goal of the project is to measure and understand how cities work in general, rather than focusing on a particular street corner or neighborhood in isolation.  This will involve doing experiments in some locations in order to learn principles that can be applied to other, similar, locations.  Combined with these experiments the project intends to cover the city with sufficient sensors to see the big picture as well as the details of particular neighborhoods.   The selection of sites is also based on interactions with Chicago communities, residents, and other local groups rather than through a top-down decision process.</p>

            <p>Images of the public way are not considered sensitive PII.  Rather, such images are considered to be public information such as can be found in phone books or on public websites, including some features in images such as faces or license plate numbers. This type of information is often referred to as “non-sensitive PII.”  </p>

            <p>In some cases it will be possible to detect a face or license plate, but the image processing software approval process prohibits the extraction of these or other identifiers from the images. Access to the images, whether those discarded within the nodes or the fraction of 1% that are saved for calibration, will be limited to individuals who have (a) demonstrated scientific need and (b) signed acceptable use agreements.</p>

            <p>No.  The City of Chicago does receive 311 calls for flooding but those calls are not always about standing water in our streets.   Additionally, the detection of standing water at the same time as measurement of environmental conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed will allow researchers to study the causes of urban flooding, and potentially provide insights that allow city departments to anticipate and prevent flooding before it occurs.</p>

            <p>The project data will provide both the public and the city with data that can drive large-scale changes. The city’s interest in sensors is to enable more effective response to various events and conditions and to develop methods for using data to predict and thus more efficiently respond to those conditions.</p>

            <p>The devices employ a variety of common protective measures, including the use of encryption of all communication and the use of a “virtual private network” that limits access to a pre-approved set of computers.  The nodes also do not support access initiated from other computers.  All communication with the nodes must be initiated by the nodes themselves, which are pre-configured to only connect to the trusted server at Argonne National Laboratory.</p>

            <p>No data with any information about an individual will be published.  All data management and access within the project team is governed by signed ethics and privacy agreements.

            <p><b>It is the following section which causes me the most concern:  "The Array of Things technology is designed and operated to protect privacy. PII data, such as could be found in images or sounds, will not be made public. For the purposes of instrument calibration, testing, and software enhancement, images and audio files that may contain PII will be periodically processed to improve, develop, and enhance algorithms that could detect and report on conditions such as street flooding, car/bicycle traffic, storm conditions, or poor visibility. Raw calibration data that could contain PII will be stored in a secure facility for processing during the course of the Array of Things project, including for purposes of improving the technology to protect PII. Access to this limited volume of data is restricted to operator employees, contractors and approved scientific partners who need to process the data for instrument design and calibration purposes, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and will be subject to discipline and/or termination if they fail to meet these obligations."  Of course the question becomes how does the public verify precisely who has such access to the PII data?  Will access parameters be modified over time?  Specifically, what assurances can one gain that the Chicago Police Department, NSA, or other agencies will not have access to this data? </b></p>
                
            <p>The documents have been clarified to differentiate between “non-sensitive PII” such as can be found in the public domain, and “sensitive PII,” which can identify an individual.  The Array of Things has no capability to access or detect sensitive PII, but can detect visual features that are considered to be “non-sensitive PII” such as faces in the public way or license plate numbers.</p>

			<p>Although not sensitive PII, the privacy and governance policies nevertheless limit who will have access to data, under what circumstances, and for the limited purpose of research and development.  The policies also outline how even this potential non-sensitive PII will be controlled, audited, and protected.  One important role of the independent external team (Technical Security and Privacy Group, Section 3.4 of the governance policy document) is to audit the project with respect to compliance to these policies.</p>

            <p>The capabilities have not been pulled back.  In early discussions about the project during 2014 the project was considering the use of WiFi and Bluetooth information, such as is routinely gathered by retailers and private entities, to determine an approximation of the number of people at a location.  The project elected not to implement this idea because, in addition to potential for misunderstanding, we determined that the technique would not yield valid scientific data.</p>

We all know cities are a complex system that constantly evolves, so will AoT's foundational pillars of privacy do the same ?   How could this public concern be quieted ?     3.  How could AoT's blend numerical data and qualitative methods to more holistically craft future privacy policies ?  </b></p>
                
            <p>Responses based on numbered questions in the above:</p>

            <p>1: The sensor capabilities have all been selected based on input from scientists and policymakers and other members of the public. As the data will be published as open and without charge, multiple groups can and will analyze the data, and the public nature of the data supports a dialog among different parties interpreting the data.</p>

            <p>2: The governance and privacy policies, and the open source approach to the technology and the data, are designed to ensure that the privacy policies remain strong and effective.</p>

            <p>3: A key objective to this project is to develop privacy policies that are effective while enabling new technologies and scientific approaches to be developed. This includes publication of the policies both to encourage suggestions and to assist similar projects in adopting stronger privacy policies and practices.</p>
