            <p class="lead">What if a light pole told you to watch out for an icy patch of sidewalk ahead? What if an app told you the most populated route for a late-night walk to the El station by yourself? What if you could get weather and air quality information block-by-block, instead of city-by-city?</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is a network of interactive, modular sensor boxes around Chicago to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use.</p>

            </h2>
              <ul class="lead">  
                <li>To better understand the natural and built environment of the city and its impact on livability with respect to climate, air quality, noise, and other factors -- effectively creating a "fitness tracker" for Chicago.
                <li>To make this data available to residents, software developers, scientists, and policymakers so that all can work together to make cities healthier, more livable, and more efficient.
                <li>To enable research, development, prototyping, and demonstration of new capabilities that require embedding hardware and software technologies in the city's infrastructure.
                <li>To enable new training and education opportunities in science and technology, particularly related to cities.</ul><br>
              <p class="lead">AoT intends to operate as a “national instrument” for urban science and technology research, ranging from technology to social sciences and education.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Data Is Collected?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Sensors in the first prototype units are aimed primarily at understanding atmosphere, air quality, and environmental factors:  temperature, humidity, light, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>), and vibration.   Additional environmental sensors including Volatile Organic Compounts (VOCs), Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), Sulfur Oxides, and Particulate Matter are being evaluated for the first prototypes as well.  Precipitation and wind measurements will be added later.</p>

            <p class="lead">Three sensors are affected by human activity. A sound sensor will collect data on ambient volume. An infared camera, pointed at nearby sidewalk and roads, collects surface temperature information. A wireless network can count the number of Bluetooth- or WiFi-enabled devices in the vicinity of the node, as a proxy for pedestrian traffic. None of these sensors will collect or record any identifying information.</p>

            <p class="lead">All software, hardware, and experiments will be regularly reviewed for privacy, security, and scientific considerations by independent experts from industry, academia, and the city. Final approval for all instrumentation and data collection will be granted through an executive committee led by the City of Chicago and including research and community membership.</p>

            </h2>

            <p class="lead">Potential applications of data collected by the Array of Things include:</p>    
            
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Monitor air quality and determine the healthiest and unhealthiest walking paths and times through the city
              <li>Detect temperature of sidewalks and roads to guide more targeted and efficient salting in winter
              <li>Measure and record micro-climate in different areas of the city
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated at different times of day to suggest safe and efficient routes for foot and vehicle traffic
              <li>Detect heavy traffic through sound and vibration

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">When And Where Will Nodes Be Installed?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first phase prototype of the Array of Things involves 50 nodes funded by Argonne National Laboratory, with the first 40 to be deployed on urban (University of Chicago, School of the Art Institute of Chicago) and suburban (Argonne National Laboratory) campuses for system reliability and resilience testing through Winter 2014.  Additional sites, including the University of Illinois-Chicago and Northern Illinois University, are under evaluation as well.</p>

            <p class="lead">An additional eight nodes will be deployed along Michigan Avenue in early 2015 pending completion of a pilot project agreement with the City of Chicago.  The AoT team is in discussions with multiple potential funding sources to deploy at least 500 additional nodes during 2015-2017, with location driven by input from residents, scientists, and policymakers.</p>

            <p class="lead">In addition, all software, hardware, parts, and specifications will also be published as open source, to encourage participation and oversight from the developer community and public. Full specifications will be available soon at <a href="https://github.com/ArrayOfThings">our Github page</a>, when the initial node design is finalized.</p>
