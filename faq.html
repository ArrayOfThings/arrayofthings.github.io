        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is Array of Things?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is an urban measurement project, a network of interactive, modular devices, or "nodes," that are installed around Chicago to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity. These measurements are published as open data for research and public use. AoT essentially serves as a “fitness tracker” for the city, measuring factors that impact livability in Chicago such as climate, air quality and noise. The project was funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation and by summer 2019 will have some 200 nodes installed throughout the city, typically at street intersections, approximately 20 feet above the street.  The technology platform used to build the noes is called <href="http://wa8.gl">Waggle</a>, an open source hardware/software system developed at Argonne National Laboratory. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What are the goals of Array of Things?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Array of Things is an experimental urban-scale “instrument” to enable the City, urban planners, residents, and researchers to monitor and examine Chicago’s environment, infrastructure and activity, including detecting trends and changes over time. Ultimately, the goal is to measure the city in sufficient detail to provide data to help engineers, scientists, policymakers and residents work together to make Chicago and other cities healthier, more livable and more efficient.</p>

        </div>

         <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">How does AoT benefit Chicago?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">AoT provides near-real-time, location-based data about the city’s environment, infrastructure and activity to researchers and the public. Over time, these measurements will allow for studies of longer term changes such as how noise levels are affected by changes in zoning, or how air quality changes following investments in clean energy.  In late 2018 a new set of application programming interfasces (or, "APIs") was released to support the development of applications, portals, and other tools to provide value from the data. For instance, several groups are developing smartphone applications that would provide navigation tips based on air quality, noise levels, or excessive heat.  Others are developing services that would allow a resident to subscribe to air quality alerts. This initiative has the potential to allow researchers, policymakers, developers and residents to work together and take specific actions that will make Chicago and other cities healthier, more efficient and more livable. </p>

	<p class="lead">The project also aspires to engage Chicago's youth in science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics ("STEAM").  Beginning in 2016, with funding from the Motorola Solutions Foundation, Chicago Public Schools faculty members at Lane Technical High School worked with the AoT team and with the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to develop a curriculum teaching students about wireless sensor devices, how they can support science and policy investigations.  Over the course of eight weeks the students learn how to formulate their inquiries, how to design and build a wireless sensor device, and then how to analyze the data once they have installed the device to operate for several weeks.  Over 450 students have been trained in the curriculum in the past four years.  In July 2018 the faculty leaders provided a one-week training session to teachers from eleven other CPS middle- and high-schools, six of which elected to try the curriculum out in the 2018-2019 school year. Similarly, partners at the University of Chicago and at Northern Illinois University have developed tutorials for high-school and undergradate students to learn how to analyze and graph or otherwise visualize AoT data.  </p>

         <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What data is collected by AoT?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Today the nodes measure temperature, barometric pressure, light, vibration, partiulate matter (PM2.5), carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, and ambient noise levels. A novel aspect of AoT nodes is that they can analyze images and sound without saving or transmitting the data.  Today each node records the number of pedestrians and the number of vehicle every 30 seconds. Continued research and development in computer vision is being done to enable the nodes to measure additional factors such as flooding or analyzing the flow of pedestrians and vehicles. </p>

        </div>

         <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who has access to the AoT data?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Data collected by AoT is open, free, and available to the public. The nodes transmit data to a secure central database server at Argonne National Laboratory. Data is then published openly to allow individuals, organizations, researchers, engineers and scientists to study urban environments, develop new data analysis tools and applications, and inform urban planning. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="applications">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What can be done with this data?
            </h2>

            <p class="lead">Potential applications of data collected by the Array of Things include:</p>

            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Sensors monitoring air quality, sound and vibration (to detect heavy vehicle traffic), and temperature can be used to suggest the healthiest and unhealthiest walking times and routes through the city, or to study the relationship between diseases and the urban environment.
              <li>Real-time detection of urban flooding can improve city services and infrastructure to prevent property damage and illness.
              <li>Measurements of micro-climate in different areas of the city, so that residents can get up-to-date, high-resolution "block-by-block" weather and climate information.
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated by pedestrians at different times of day to suggest safe and efficient routes for walking late at night or for timing traffic lights during peak traffic hours to improve pedestrian safety and reduce congestion-related pollution.
            </ul>

             <p class="lead">But importantly, the team expects that many unanticipated, innovative applications will be constructed by outside parties using the open Array of Things data, realizing the potential of an open, community-based initiative.</p>

        </div>

         <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">When and where will nodes be installed?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In partnership with the Chicago Departmentof Transportation (CDOT), 100 nodes were installed in early 2018.  An additional 100 nodes began going up in April 2019 and are expected to be fully deployed by summer 2019.  The nodes are typically mounted on traffic signal light poles, though some of the nodes going in during 2019 will be mounted on buildings. The team continues to seek research and development funding to expand the system with additional nodes and with new technologies in the coming years. In addition the CDOT, the Array of Things works with the City of Chicago’s Department of Innovation and Technology (DoIT), the Chicago Park District, and the Chicago Fleets and Facilities Management.</p>

	<p class="lead"> Node locations are chosen with input from researchers, neighborhood groups, city departments, and community members. The goal is to work with these and other groups to place nodes in support of local concerns and interests, such as in air quality, traffic safety, or noise. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">The Nodes have cameras. How is privacy protected?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In late 2014 the AoT team drafted a set of privacy policies, governance structures, and decision procedures to ensure that the project would protect personal privacy in a transparent and accountable fashion.  These policies include an executive oversight committee comprising Chicago leaders from industry, academia, government, law, and the community, and a process for reviewing privacy policies and their implementation, as well as change that might be proposed over time.  To protect privacy, all AoT images are analyzed within the nodes rather than transmitted and stored for later use.  Analysis of images is also limited to pre-approved functions, such as "count the number of pededstrians" or "detect standing water (flooding)."  The privacy does allow for a limited volume of images to be collected in order to develop the computer vision software, but these images are protected and only accessible to academic researchers who have signed a data use agreement.  The full policies are availabe at <a href="https://arrayofthings.github.io/privacypolicy.html">AoT Policies</a>, where profiles of all of the members of the AoT executive oversight committee can also be found.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Will the nodes collect information about individual people?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">No.Array of Things is supporting analysis of, and monitoring over time, the city’s environment and activity, not individuals. In fact, the technology and policy have been designed to specifically avoid any potential collection of data about individuals, so privacy protection is built into the design of the sensors and into the operating policies.</p>


        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">I heard that sensors will be installed to monitor Bluetooth-enabled devices and WiFi signals. Is this true?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">No. None of the AoT nodes will measure the presence of Bluetooth/WiFi devices or communicate in any way with other devices The nodes are programmed to communicate using cellular data, and only with the central database at Argonne. In its formative stages, the project considered including such sensors in the nodes, but decided against it for two reasons. First, research by other groups indicated that the measurements would be biased toward people who own connected devices and thus would not provide the most accurate indicator of foot traffic. Second, it was clear that most people would be apprehensive about a system that could contact their personal devices in any way.</p>

        </div>

         <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What other cities will be using AoT nodes?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The project has received over 100 requests from cities and universities to partner with the Array of Things team. Through a rapidly expanding partnership program, nodes are being installed in Seattle, Portland, Palo Alto, Denver, Syracuse, Chapel Hill, Atlanta, and Nashville.  Outside of the U.S. there are devices scheduled to be installed in Bristol (England), Santo Domingo (Dominican Republic), Taichung City (Taiwan), and several cities in Australia.  Nearly all of these projects are led by research partners at universities within those cities. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who is the Array of Things team?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project is led by Charlie Catlett and researchers from the <a href="http://www.urbanccd.org">Urban Center for Computation and Data</a> of the <a href="http://ci.uchicago.edu">Computation Institute</a>, a joint initiative of <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a> and the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>. The underlying software and hardware design, known as <a href="http://wa8.gl/">Waggle</a>, was developed at Argonne National Laboratory by Pete Beckman, Charlie Catlett, Rajesh Sankaran, and dozens of student interns over multiple summers. The custom enclosure for the sensor nodes was developed by <a href="http://www.pdt.com/">Product Development Technologies</a>, based on early designs from Douglas Pancoast and Satya Mark Basu of the <a href="http://www.saic.edu">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a>. </p>

	<p class="lead">While each AoT node contains commercial components from many sources, the majority of the custom aspects of the nodes are sourced in Chicagoland.  The white sensor shields, for instance, are injection molded new O'Hare Airport.  All of the custom circuit boards are made by Surya Electronics in Glendale Heights, Illinois.  Surya also does all of the assembly of the nodes. The project is executed in partnership with the City of Chicago, with coordination by the City's Chief Information Officer (presently Ms. Danielle DuMerer).</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project also involves partnerships between the Argonne andUChicago team and scientists at academic institutions including Northwestern University, Northern Illinois University, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, DePaul University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Purdue University, University of Notre Dame, and DePaul University. The project has benefited from support and technical advice provided by corporate partners including AT&T, Cisco, Microsoft, Schneider Electric, Intel, Motorola Solutions, and Zebra Technologies.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Who is funding AoT?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The University of Chicago received a $3.1 million grant from the National Science Foundation for the AoT project. The project has also received investments of $150,000 each from the Chicago Innovation Exchange and Argonne National Laboratory to fund the initial  pilot project. The underlying platform technology is the result of over $1 million of internal research funding from Argonne National Laboratory. Additionally, the City of Chicago has provided installation of and power for the nodes</p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">How much does an AoT node cost?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">AoT nodes are experimental, and we expect that some nodes may have expanded capabilities, such as anemometers (to measure wind speed), precise air particle sensors (to measure pollutants like smoke or pollen), and sky-facing imagers to understand cloud cover and sunlight. The cost will vary based on the exact selectin of sensors and other components. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="featurette" id="about">

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">How much will this project cost the City of Chicago?

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The City of Chicago provided node installation and provide electricity to them from the City’s power supply via the traffic signal poles to which nodes are attached.  The amount of electricity drawn by each node is roughly 50 Watts - about the same amount that is required to charge a cell phone). The nodes, all mounting supplies, and cellular communications were all funded through the National Science Foundation grant.</p>
