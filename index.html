            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Is The Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What if a light pole told you to watch out for an icy patch of sidewalk ahead? What if an app told you the most populated route for a late-night walk to the El station by yourself? What if you could get weather and air quality information block-by-block, instead of city-by-city?</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is an urban sensing project, a network of interactive, modular sensor boxes that will be installed around Chicago to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use. AoT will essentially serve as a “fitness tracker” for the city, measuring factors that impact livability in Chicago such as climate, air quality and noise.</p>

            </h2>
              
              <p class="lead">AoT will provide real-time, location-based data about the city’s environment, infrastructure and activity to researchers and the public. This initiative has the potential to allow researchers, policymakers, developers and residents to work together and take specific actions that will make Chicago and other cities healthier, more efficient and more livable. The data will help make Chicago a truly “smart city,” allowing the City to operate more efficiently and realize cost savings by anticipating and proactively addressing challenges such as urban flooding and traffic safety.</p>  

            <p class="lead">Because the data will be published openly and without charge, it will also support the development of innovative applications, such as a mobile application that allows a resident to track their exposure to certain air contaminants, or to navigate through the city based on avoiding urban heat islands, poor air quality, or excessive noise and congestion.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Data is Collected?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The nodes will initially measure temperature, barometric pressure, light, vibration, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, ambient sound intensity, pedestrian and vehicle traffic, and surface temperature. Continued research and development will help create sensors to monitor other urban factors of interest such as flooding and standing water, precipitation, wind, and pollutants.</p>

            <p class="lead">Array of Things is interested in monitoring the city’s environment and activity, not individuals.  In fact, the technology and policy have been designed to specifically minimize any potential collection of data about individuals, so privacy protection is built into the design of the sensors and into the <a href="/privacypolicy.html">operating policies</a>.</p>

            </h2>

            <p class="lead">Potential applications of data collected by the Array of Things include:</p>    
            
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Sensors monitoring air quality, sound and vibration (to detect heavy vehicle traffic), and temperature can be used to suggest the healthiest and unhealthiest walking times and routes through the city, or to study the relationship between diseases and the urban environment.
              <li>Real-time detection of urban flooding can improve city services and infrastructure to prevent property damage and illness.
              <li>Measurements of micro-climate in different areas of the city, so that residents can get up-to-date, high-resolution "block-by-block" weather and climate information.
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated by pedestrians at different times of day to suggest safe and efficient routes for walking late at night or for timing traffic lights during peak traffic hours to improve pedestrian safety and reduce congestion-related pollution.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Data Will be Available?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Data collected by AoT will be open, free, and available to the public. The nodes will transmit data to a secure central database server at Argonne National Laboratory. Data will then be published openly to allow individuals, organizations, researchers, engineers and scientists to study urban environments, develop new data analysis tools and applications, and inform urban planning. Raw data will also be posted to the City of Chicago’s open data network and <a href="http://plenar.io">Plenario</a>, a web-based portal that supports open data search, exploration, and downloading with open datasets from Chicago and around the world. </p>

            <p class="lead">In addition, software, hardware, parts, and specifications will also be published as open source, to encourage participation and oversight from the developer community and public. You can view <a href="/node.html">the architecture and current sensor list of the nodes here</a>. Full specifications will be available soon at <a href="https://github.com/ArrayOfThings">our Github page</a>, when the initial node design is finalized.</p>

            </h2>

            <p class="lead">All hardware, software and data being collected will be regularly reviewed by a Technical Security and Privacy Group chaired by Von Welch, director of Indiana University’s Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research. Operating as an external, independent review team, the committee will also be consulted whenever there is a request for a new kind of data to be collected. </p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things Executive Oversight Council will be co-chaired by Commissioner of the City's Department of Innovation and Technology Brenna Berman, Urban Center for Computation & Data Director Charlie Catlett, with additional members selected from academia, industry, non-profits, and the community. No data will be monitored without the approval of the privacy and security external oversight committee, the City of Chicago and the AoT executive committee, and the operation of the Array of Things will be governed by <a href="/privacypolicy.html">privacy policies</a> that will be published prior to installation of nodes.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project is led by Charlie Catlett and researchers from the <a href="http://www.urbanccd.org">Urban Center for Computation and Data</a> of the <a href="http://ci.uchicago.edu">Computation Institute</a>, a joint initiative of <a href="http://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a> and the <a href="http://www.uchicago.edu">University of Chicago</a>. The underlying software and hardware design, known as <a href="http://wa8.gl/">Waggle</a>, was developed at Argonne National Laboratory by Pete Beckman, Rajesh Sankaran, and Charlie Catlett. The custom enclosure for the sensor nodes was developed by <a href="http://www.pdt.com/">Product Development Technologies</a>, based on early designs from Douglas Pancoast and Satya Mark Basu of the <a href="http://www.saic.edu">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a>. The project is executed in partnership with the City of Chicago.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project also involves partnerships with scientists at academic institutions including Northern Illinois University, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, DePaul University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Purdue University, University of Notre Dame, Arizona State University, the Santa Fe Institute, University College London, Clemson University, and the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia. AT&T is the project’s communications partner, providing all AoT connectivity for Chicago. Technical advice and support comes from a growing number of industry partners including Cisco, Microsoft, Schneider Electric, Intel, Motorola Solutions, and Zebra Technologies.</p>
