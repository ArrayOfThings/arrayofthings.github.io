            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Is The Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What if a light pole told you to watch out for an icy patch of sidewalk ahead? What if an app told you the most populated route for a late-night walk to the El station by yourself? What if you could get weather and air quality information block-by-block, instead of city-by-city?</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is an urban sensing network of programmable, modular nodes that will be installed around cities to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use. AoT will essentially serve as a “fitness tracker” for the city, measuring factors that impact livability in cities such as climate, air quality and noise.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is the Goal of the Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
              
              <p class="lead">AoT will provide real-time, location-based data about urban environment, infrastructure and activity to researchers and the public. This initiative has the potential to allow researchers, policymakers, developers and residents to work together and take specific actions that will make cities healthier, more efficient and more livable. The data will help cities operate more efficiently and realize cost savings by anticipating and proactively addressing challenges such as urban flooding and traffic safety.</p>  

            <p class="lead">Because the data will be published openly and without charge, it will also support the development of innovative applications, such as a mobile application that allows a resident to track their exposure to certain air contaminants, or to navigate through the city based on avoiding urban heat islands, poor air quality, or excessive noise and congestion.</p>

            <p class="lead">Array of Things also serves as the flagship deployment of an innovative new type of cyberinfrastructure -- a distributed, programmable system of nodes that can be used to answer critical research questions across different settings and fields of study. AoT is based upon <a href="https://wa8.gl/">Waggle technology</a>, an open platform for edge computing and intelligent, wireless sensors developed at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition to AoT and other urban research initiatives, Waggle software and hardware supports environmental and atmospheric science in a variety of environments, from the Chicago Botanic Garden to the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Research Facility in Oklahoma.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Data is Collected?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The nodes will initially measure temperature, barometric pressure, light, vibration, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, ambient sound intensity, and pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Continued research and development is using machine learning to create sensors to monitor other urban factors of interest such as flooding and standing water.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project is interested in monitoring urban environment and activity, not individuals. In fact, the technology and policy have been designed to specifically minimize any potential collection of data about individuals, so privacy protection is built into the design of the sensors and into the <a href="/privacypolicy.html">operating policies</a>.</p>

            </h2>

            <p class="lead">Potential applications of data collected by the Array of Things include:</p>    
            
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Sensors monitoring air quality, sound and vibration (to detect heavy vehicle traffic), and temperature can be used to suggest the healthiest and unhealthiest walking times and routes through the city, or to study the relationship between diseases and the urban environment.
              <li>Real-time detection of urban flooding can improve city services and infrastructure to prevent property damage and illness.
              <li>Measurements of micro-climate in different areas of the city, so that residents can get up-to-date, high-resolution "block-by-block" weather and climate information.
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated by pedestrians at different times of day to suggest safe and efficient routes for walking late at night or for timing traffic lights during peak traffic hours to improve pedestrian safety and reduce congestion-related pollution.
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">Array of Things data and technology will also be available for educational purposes, engaging local students and training them on important job skills.

            <p class="lead">Data collected by AoT is open, free, and available to the public. The nodes transmit data to a secure central database server at Argonne National Laboratory. Data is then <a href="https://aot-file-browser.plenar.io/">published openly</a> to allow individuals, organizations, researchers, engineers and scientists to study urban environments, develop new data analysis tools and applications, and inform urban planning. In addition to local open data portals, data from all AoT deployments will be published at <a href="http://plenar.io">Plenario</a>, a web-based portal that supports open data search, exploration, and downloading with open datasets from around the world. </p>

            <p class="lead">In addition, software, hardware, parts, and specifications will also be published as open source, to encourage participation and oversight from the developer community and public. You can view <a href="/node.html">the architecture and current sensor list of the nodes here</a>. Full specifications will be available soon at <a href="https://github.com/ArrayOfThings">our Github page</a>, when the initial node design is finalized.</p>

            <p class="lead">The EOC draws upon external technical security and privacy expertise through the Technical Security and Privacy Group, chaired by Von Welch, director of Indiana University’s <a href="https://cacr.iu.edu/index.html">Center for Applied Cybersecurity Research</a>. Operating as an external, independent review team, the committee will also be consulted whenever there is a request for a new kind of data to be collected. </p>

The underlying open software and hardware platform, known as <a href="http://wa8.gl/">Waggle</a>, was developed at Argonne National Laboratory by Pete Beckman, Rajesh Sankaran, and Charlie Catlett. The custom enclosure for the sensor nodes was developed by <a href="http://www.pdt.com/">Product Development Technologies</a>, based on early designs from Douglas Pancoast and Satya Mark Basu of the <a href="http://www.saic.edu">School of the Art Institute of Chicago</a>. The project is executed in partnership with the City of Chicago.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project has been guided by a series of scientific collaborations and <a href="http://www.urbanccd.org/past-events">workshops</a> beginning in 2013, with participation from scientists at academic institutions including Northern Illinois University, University of Illinois at Chicago, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, DePaul University, Illinois Institute of Technology, Purdue University, University of Notre Dame, Arizona State University, the Santa Fe Institute, University College London, Clemson University, and the Institute for Advanced Architecture of Catalonia. AT&T is the project’s communications partner, providing all AoT connectivity for Chicago.
