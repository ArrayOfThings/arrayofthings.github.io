  AoT is an anchor partner in the NSF-funded mid-scale research infrastructure project called
  <a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">SAGE</a>.
  </b></p>         


In 2019 the AoT team joined with a broader community of scientists including those interested in measuring
the natural environment and natural disasers. The new project, SAGE, was funded through the
National Science Foundation's Mid-Scale Research
Infrastuructre program. The SAGE platform vision incorporated lessons learned from
the AoT project, NSF's National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), UCSD's WiFire (wildfire
monitoring) program, and others to create a new generation of Argonne National Laboratory's
<a href="https://docs.sagecontinuum.org/docs/about/overview">Waggle</a>
hardware and software infrastructure.  
Called <a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">SAGE: A Software-Defined Sensor Network</a>, the new
project created devices with test units replacing a number of original AoT nodes in late 2021.  Many 
more will be replaced in 2022 as the new platform undergoes extensive testing and evaluation.
SAGE is led by the Northwestern-Argonne Institute for Science and Engineering
(<a href="https://naise.northwestern.edu/">NAISE</a>).
in partnership with 
the University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory, the University of Colorado,
the University of California-San Diego, Northern Illinois University, the University of Utah,
and George Mason University.

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is The Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What if a light pole told you to watch out for an icy patch of sidewalk ahead? What if an app told you the most populated route for a late-night walk to the El station by yourself? What if you could get weather and air quality information block-by-block, instead of city-by-city?</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is an experimental urban measurement system comprising programmable, modular "nodes" with sensors and computing capability so that they can analyze data internally, for instance counting the number of vehicles at an intersection (and then deleting the image data rather than sending it to a data center). AoT nodes are installed in Chicago and a growing number of partner cities to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use. The concept of AoT is analogous to a “fitness tracker” for the city, measuring factors that impact livability in the urban environment, such as climate, air quality, and noise.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is the Goal of the Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
              
              <p class="lead">AoT will provide real-time, location-based data about urban environment, infrastructure and activity to researchers and the public. This initiative has the potential to allow researchers, policymakers, developers and residents to work together and take specific actions that will make cities healthier, more efficient and more livable. The data will help cities operate more efficiently and realize cost savings by anticipating and proactively addressing challenges such as urban flooding and traffic safety.</p>  

            <p class="lead">Because the data is published openly and without charge, it can also support the development of innovative applications, such as a mobile application that allows a resident to track their exposure to certain air contaminants, or to navigate through the city based on avoiding urban heat islands, poor air quality, or excessive noise and congestion.</p>

            <p class="lead">Array of Things also serves as the flagship deployment of an innovative new type of cyberinfrastructure -- a distributed, programmable system of nodes that can be used to answer critical research questions across different settings and fields of study. AoT is based upon <a href="https://wa8.gl/">Waggle technology</a>, an open platform for edge computing and intelligent, wireless sensors developed at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition to AoT and other urban research initiatives, Waggle software and hardware supports environmental and atmospheric science in a variety of environments, from the Chicago Botanic Garden to the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Research Facility in Oklahoma. In October 2019 the Waggle team was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation for 
a new project called <a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">SAGE: A Software-Defined Sensor Network.</a>

SAGE will create a new generation of Waggle node with upgraded sensors and more powerful computing for AI "at the edge." This new node technology will be tested not only in AoT but also in NSF's <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/news/special_reports/neon/">National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)</a> with enhanced climate and environmental measurement capabilities, and in the University of Califoria-San Diego's <a href="https://wifire.ucsd.edu/">WIFIRE</a> project.  NEON operates over 100 environmental measurement sites across the United States, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, publishing ecological and environmental data to understand pheomena such as the impact of agriculture or urbanization on the natural environment.
WIFIRE operates roughly 80 towers across Southern California, providing real-time data for wildfire prevention and response.

            <p class="lead">The nodes will initially measure temperature, barometric pressure, light, vibration, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, ambient sound pressure, and pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Continued research and development is using machine learning to create sensors to monitor other urban factors of interest such as solar light intensity (visible, UV, and IR) and cloud cover (important to building energy management), and flooding and standing water.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project is interested in monitoring urban environment and activity, not individuals. In fact, the technology and policy have been designed to specifically minimize any potential collection of data about individuals, so privacy protection is built into the design of the sensors and into the <a href="/privacypolicy.html">operating policies</a>.</p>

            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Sensors monitoring air quality, sound, and vibration (to detect heavy vehicle traffic) might be used to suggest the healthiest and unhealthiest walking times and routes through the city, or to study the relationship between diseases and the urban environment.
              <li>Real-time detection of urban flooding can improve city services and infrastructure to prevent property damage and illness.
              <li>Measurements of micro-climate in different areas of the city, so that residents can get up-to-date, high-resolution "block-by-block" weather and climate information.
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated by pedestrians at different times of day to suggest safe and efficient routes for walking late at night or for timing traffic lights during peak traffic hours to improve pedestrian safety and reduce congestion-related pollution.
