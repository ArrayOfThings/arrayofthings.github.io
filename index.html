 <p class="lead text-left"><b>Welcome to the Array of Things, an intelligent urban measurement project that’s changing our understanding of cities and urban life.</b></p>         
         
  <p class="lead text-left">The Array of Things (AoT) is a collaborative effort among scientists, universities, federallocal government, industry partners, and communities to collect real-time data on urban environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use. AoT uses an open intelligent sensing and edge computing platform called <a href="https://wa8.gl">Waggle</a>, developed at <a href="https://www.anl.gov">Argonne National Laboratory</a>.  AoT is funded primarily by the U.S. National Science Foundation. As of October 2019, AoT became an anchor partner in a new NSF-funded project called <a href="https://sagecontinuum.org">SAGE: A Software-Defined Sensor Network</a></p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Is The Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What if a light pole told you to watch out for an icy patch of sidewalk ahead? What if an app told you the most populated route for a late-night walk to the El station by yourself? What if you could get weather and air quality information block-by-block, instead of city-by-city?</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things (AoT) is an experimental urban measurement system comprising programmable, modular "nodes" with sensors and computing capability so that they can analyze data internally, for instance counting the number of vehicles at an intersection (and then deleting the image data rather than sending it to a data center). AoT nodes are installed in Chicago and a growing number of partner cities to collect real-time data on the city’s environment, infrastructure, and activity for research and public use. The concept of AoT is analogous to a “fitness tracker” for the city, measuring factors that impact livability in the urban environment, such as climate, air quality, and noise.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What is the Goal of the Array of Things?
                
            </h2>
              
              <p class="lead">AoT will provide real-time, location-based data about urban environment, infrastructure and activity to researchers and the public. This initiative has the potential to allow researchers, policymakers, developers and residents to work together and take specific actions that will make cities healthier, more efficient and more livable. The data will help cities operate more efficiently and realize cost savings by anticipating and proactively addressing challenges such as urban flooding and traffic safety.</p>  

            <p class="lead">Because the data will be published openly and without charge, it will also support the development of innovative applications, such as a mobile application that allows a resident to track their exposure to certain air contaminants, or to navigate through the city based on avoiding urban heat islands, poor air quality, or excessive noise and congestion.</p>

            <p class="lead">Array of Things also serves as the flagship deployment of an innovative new type of cyberinfrastructure -- a distributed, programmable system of nodes that can be used to answer critical research questions across different settings and fields of study. AoT is based upon <a href="https://wa8.gl/">Waggle technology</a>, an open platform for edge computing and intelligent, wireless sensors developed at Argonne National Laboratory. In addition to AoT and other urban research initiatives, Waggle software and hardware supports environmental and atmospheric science in a variety of environments, from the Chicago Botanic Garden to the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Research Facility in Oklahoma.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">What Data is Collected?
                
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The nodes will initially measure temperature, barometric pressure, light, vibration, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, ozone, ambient sound pressure, and pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Continued research and development is using machine learning to create sensors to monitor other urban factors of interest such as solar light intensity (visible, UV, and IR) and cloud cover (important to building energy management), and flooding and standing water.</p>

            <p class="lead">The Array of Things project is interested in monitoring urban environment and activity, not individuals. In fact, the technology and policy have been designed to specifically minimize any potential collection of data about individuals, so privacy protection is built into the design of the sensors and into the <a href="/privacypolicy.html">operating policies</a>.</p>

            </h2>

            <p class="lead">Potential applications of data collected by the Array of Things include:</p>    
            
            <ul class="lead">
              <li>Sensors monitoring air quality, sound and vibration (to detect heavy vehicle traffic), and temperature can be used to suggest the healthiest and unhealthiest walking times and routes through the city, or to study the relationship between diseases and the urban environment.
              <li>Real-time detection of urban flooding can improve city services and infrastructure to prevent property damage and illness.
              <li>Measurements of micro-climate in different areas of the city, so that residents can get up-to-date, high-resolution "block-by-block" weather and climate information.
              <li>Observe which areas of the city are heavily populated by pedestrians at different times of day to suggest safe and efficient routes for walking late at night or for timing traffic lights during peak traffic hours to improve pedestrian safety and reduce congestion-related pollution.
            </ul>

            <p class="lead">Array of Things data and technology will also be available for educational purposes, engaging local students and training them on important job skills.

            <p class="lead">Data collected by AoT is open, free, and available to the public. The nodes transmit data to a secure central database server at Argonne National Laboratory. Data is then <a href="https://aot-file-browser.plenar.io/">published openly</a> to allow individuals, organizations, researchers, engineers and scientists to study urban environments, develop new data analysis tools and applications, and inform urban planning. </p>

            <p class="lead">In addition, software, hardware, parts, and specifications will also be published as open source, to encourage participation and oversight from the developer community and public.

<a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdot.html">Chicago Department of Transportatin (CDOT)</a>,
and specifically by office of Electrical Operations. 
The EOC and AoT leadership team solicit input from researchers, neighborhood groups, and community members to determine the best locations for the deployment of AoT nodes. <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Environment-Sustainable-Development/Array-of-Things-Locations-Map/2dng-xkng">View a map of the current node locations</a> at the City of Chicago Open Data Portal. As of January 2020 there were roughly 130 nodes installed throughout Chicago. In 2020 we plan to upgrade many nodes (some of which were installed as early as 2016) and expand to 150 locations. </p>

            <p class="lead">Since the project launched in 2015, we've heard from over one hundred cities interested in their own local deployment of Array of Things technology, and started several <a href="https://medium.com/array-of-things/array-of-things-expands-with-partner-projects-around-u-s-c0ef9171f314">partner projects</a> in cities such as Palo Alto, Seattle, Portland, Denver, Chapel Hill, and Syracuse.
